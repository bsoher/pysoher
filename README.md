Random bits of working Python code and examples (aka 'snippets') for MR spectroscopy 
scienctific explorations, radical file I/O and astounding GUI applications. No adjectives
were harmed in the word smithing of this project description.

## Installation

Basically, download a zip file of the repository locally, or fork a copy of 
the repository to your Github account and you are ready to go. 

## Usage

Most files are standalone algorithms. If multiple files are required, I have 
tried to put these code bits into their own sub-subdirectories.

### Directory Descriptions

**algos** - algorithms for filters and other sciency things like 'lowess' and 'hlsvdpro'.

**wxpython_stuff** - like the name says, I've got routines to generalize including matplotlib
plots and image displays into wxpython windows.  

All modules have built in examples for running/using the code. Typically just 
type:

`>python module_name.py`

at the command line and something should happen.  The module and method 
docstrings should shed some light on each module's API, but take a look at 
the test code too to see more details about using the code.

## Contributing - I love contributions!

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D

## History

Most of these modules/algorithms have been developed as part of the 
**Vespa: Versatile Simulation Pulses and Analysis** package. This is a multi-application, 
open-source Python project for MR Spectroscopy research. The main website for this 
project is:
